# CHRoot Evasion

You must have root privileges.

How does it work?

- Inside the **chroot** environment create a new directory that will receive the new chroot env.                               
- Change the root directory of this process to the second **chroot** environment as that created folder.                        
- Change the **current working directory** to a dir relatively outside the first container.                                     
- Change the root directory of the process to the current working directory, the **real** root directory, using chroot(".").    
- Spawn the shell.
